                             <p>
                                 Purpose of auth service is authentication and authorization of users. This is place of
                                 managing access to services. Auth service can be used from external systems for
                                 checking access of users to methods of service. Any service can be added and described
                                 into auth.
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                 In auth service used such concepts as: environment, user, service, group, notification,
                                 action log. Let's watch closer on each of it.

                                 Environment is a container isolated from other environments. So users, services, groups,
                                 e.t.c. are creates in scope of environment and not reachable from another environments.
                                 Anyone and anything from one environment can't be moved or used in context of other
                                 environment. Environment concept required, for example, for handling different
                                 organisations on the same instance of Helixproject platform.

                                 Service has name, type and properties. Type is unique service identifier used in

                                 Name of service is human readable description of service.<br>
                                 Properties is list of methods of service. Access control checks on level of properties.
                                 This means that on checking access we have user, service, property and calculates
                                 current user rights for detecting is access allowed.
