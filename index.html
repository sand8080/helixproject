                             <p>
                                 Purpose of auth service is authentication and authorization of users. This is place of
                                 managing access to services. Auth service can be used from external systems for
                                 checking access of users to methods of service. Any service can be added into auth
                                 and described.
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                 In auth service used such components as: environment, user, service, group, notification,
                                 action log, session. Let's watch closer on each of it.

                                 <b>Environment</b><br>

                                 Environment is a container isolated from other environments. Environments are like a
                                 boxes with toys. So users, services, groups e.t.c. are created in scope of environment
                                 and not reachable from another environments.
                                 Anyone and anything from one environment can't be moved or used in context of other
                                 environment. Environment concept required, for example, for handling different
                                 organisations on the same instance of Helixproject platform.

                                 <b>Service</b><br>
                                 Service has name, type and properties. Type is unique service identifier used in
                                 other services for checking access of user to service properties (methods).<br>

                                 Name of service is human readable description of service.<br>

                                 Properties is list of methods of service. Access control checks on level of properties.
                                 This means that on checking access we have user, service, property and calculates
                                 current user rights for detecting is access allowed.<br>

                                 Service can be deactivated, modified name and type.
                             </p>

                                 Group is definition of services access rules. Group has name, can be deactivated and
                                 can be default. All properties of group can be changed. Default groups used in user
                                 creation as possible set of user groups membership. While environment creates set of
                                 groups (Users, Administrators) will be also created.<br>

                                 For example, in group Users for service Auth allowed access to property get_user_rights.
                                 User can be member of several groups. Access to service property is allowed if in any
                                 of active user groups access is allowed.
